# Linux dotfiles

If you are looking to browse for ideas, check out these:

* [Zsh/Bash aliases, exports, and functions](shell.sh)
* [Zsh configuration](.zshrc)
* [Vim/Nvim](.vimrc)
* [Bash/Python scripts](bin)

Some great dotfiles repositories by others that majorly influenced my own:

* <https://github.com/Shougo/shougo-s-github> Especially the Vim stuff.
* <https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles>
* <https://github.com/casey/dotfiles>
  * Especially [edmv](https://github.com/casey/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/edmv), a bulk rename utility that is so great that I had to backup it in this repository.
