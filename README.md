# Dotfiles

If you are looking to browse for ideas, may I suggest these files:

* `shell.sh`: Zsh/bash aliases, exports, and functions.
* `.vimrc`
* `.zshrc`
* Everything in the `bin/` folder.

Some great dotfiles repositories by others, I wish I would remember them all:

* <https://github.com/casey/dotfiles>
* <https://github.com/Shougo/shougo-s-github> Especially the Vim stuff.
* <https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles>
* <https://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles> broken?

Saving this as a reminder to do some more browsing myself: <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles#User_repositories>
