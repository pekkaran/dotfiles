## easycrop

A simple mpv script for manually cropping videos with ease.

* Works during video playback
* No need to re-encode or modify video files

### Installation

Place `easycrop.lua` in your `~/.mpv/scripts` or `~/.config/mpv/scripts` directory.

### Usage

Press `c` to begin cropping. Click at one corner of the desired cropping
rectangle, and click a second time at the opposite corner; the video will
be cropped immediately. Pressing `c` again will undo the current crop.

If you wish to use a key other than `c` to crop, the keybind `easy_crop` can be
changed.
